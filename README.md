# NYC 311 Service Requests Analysis

Group Project Overview for CIS9650.
Group Members: Mengyan Huang, Jinxi Huang, Kay Jiang, Sunny Liu, Xinli Hou

## Problem Statement
We would like to analyze the patterns of Non-emergency Service Requests (SR). Another goal is to discover external triggers or affecting factors to NYC residentsâ€™ complaints, such as weather, politics, gaming, shooting incidents, and other social events. We aim to provide helpful recommendations to improve work efficiency of government agencies and enhance NYC citizens satisfaction, and insights to future complaints prediction and management.
